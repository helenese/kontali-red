# Hackathon Solution: Technology + Sustainability

## Theme: Energy • Ocean • Society

Welcome to our project repository, where we've embraced the hackathon's theme of "TEKNOLOGI + BÆREKRAFT: Energi • Hav • Samfunn" (Technology + Sustainability: Energy • Ocean • Society). Our solution aims to address the critical intersection of technology and sustainability, focusing on how innovative approaches can contribute to a more sustainable future in the domains of energy, ocean conservation, and societal well-being.

### Overview

Our project is a multi-faceted solution designed to tackle challenges across the three key areas highlighted by the hackathon theme. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we aim to create sustainable solutions that benefit both the planet and its inhabitants. Our project is divided into three main components:

1. **Energy:** Innovative renewable energy solutions to reduce carbon footprint and promote energy independence.
2. **Ocean:** Technologies for ocean conservation, including pollution reduction and marine ecosystem protection.
3. **Society:** Initiatives that use technology to promote sustainability in communities, focusing on education, awareness, and sustainable practices.
